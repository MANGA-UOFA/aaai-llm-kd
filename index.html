    <h1>AAAI'26 Tutorial<br> Knowledge Distillation for Language Models:<br> Challenges and Opportunities with Sequential Data</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="abstract">
    <h2>Tutorial Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique that transfers the knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, where the teacher is usually larger and more powerful.
      In this tutorial, we will briefly introduce the basic concepts, including intermediate-layer matching and prediction-matching KD.
      We then dive into the challenges and opportunities of KD with sequential data, which lead to advanced techniques such as reinforcement learning KD and multi-teacher KD.
      We will also cover practical KD applications such as LLM sequence compression and LLM self-distillation.
      The goal of this tutorial is to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the techniques and applications of KD for language models.
